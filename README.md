# CardioKare
## Description:
CardioKare is a webbased health application that uses machine learning to assess a user's likelihood of have Coronary Artery Disease, which is the most common heart disease in the world. By analyzing data inputed by the everyday user CardioKare offers educational resources and facts to promote awareness and prevention of a disease which is the leading cause of death globally. CardioKare combines software engineering, biomedical research, and data science to promote early detection and treatment of a generally uncurable disease.

## Contributions: 
ðŸ’¡Full stack Developer | Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer 
Machine Learning Model: Trained a Random Forest Classifier on a cleaned Kaggle dataset to predict Coronary Artery Disease risk with 89% accuracy.
Frontend: Designed a user-friendly web interface using HTML and CSS to collect patient data via form inputs that match the modelâ€™s expected format.
Backend: Built with Flask to connect the frontend form to the machine learning model, process user inputs, and return prediction results in real time.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and formatted raw medical data from Kaggle to ensure accurate training and input matching.

ðŸ’» Software Engineer - Lia (Front-end), Mateo (Back-end) 
Web App Frontend: Build the user-facing platform for inputting patient data and displaying risk predictions, done with HTML, CSS
Backend Logic: Translate MATLAB models into Python (or use MATLAB Compiler SDK to deploy models) for risk scoring using API and Flask. 
Database: Handle storage of user inputs and anonymized medical records for testing.
Visualization: Graph blood flow, stenosis progression, and outputs from MATLAB simulations on the front end.

ðŸ§  Biomedical Engineer - Jhoan Gonzales (MATLAB/Clinical Guider for CAD) 
Physiology Expert: Understand the pathophysiology of CAD â€” how plaque buildup narrows arteries and affects blood flow through MATLAB Code
Data Gathering: Curate clinical datasets (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG, angiography results).
Modeling Support: Work with MATLAB to design physiological models of coronary blood flow (e.g., using Windkessel or fluid dynamics equations).
Risk Algorithms: Define CAD risk factors (e.g., Framingham Risk Score, calcium scoring, heart rate variability) and metrics.

ðŸ’» Research Engineer - Reshma
CAD Processing: ProAssist SWE in diagraming a way to build the Software, 
CAD Research - Helped conduct research on CAD and its effects, exporting the needed materials to assist SWER.
